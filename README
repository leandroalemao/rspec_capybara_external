This is a basic proof of concept. Based on the example from https://github.com/beckelmw/Capybara-External-Testing

This uses: 
 * rspec
 * capybara
 * selenium
 * and an external website

It's a basic point and click robot that doesn't require a local rails app to exist. 

It's useful for automated web interface testing on external addresses, where the ability to run an application locally is restricted or in the too-hard basket. 

How to:

1. `bundle install`
2. `bundle exec rspec`
3. ... <firefox>
4. completed test.

But what about headlessness?

You can do this, but I wanted a click-and-point robot. 

You can headless by going: 
+require 'capybara/webkit'
+Capybara.default_driver = :webkit
